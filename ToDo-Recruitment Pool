Ok let me summarize (a little bit adjusted):
- I add as much as possible new nations to the pool
- I add all WA nations from the pacifics that have a residency less than 7 days to the pool
If the pool size is < minimum:
- I randomly pick WA nations from all GCRs with residency less than 7 days and add them to the pool
- If that isn't enough: I randomly pick any non WA nations from all GCRs with residency less than 7 days and add them to the pool

I filter out:
- Any nations with numbers in the pool
- Any nations with "founder" in the pool

I remove from pool:
- If a nation cted (to be determined via dumps - check after dump update)
- If a nation already moved to another UCR (to be determined via dumps - check after dump update)
- If a nations residency is larger then 3 days (to be determined via dumps - check after dump update)
