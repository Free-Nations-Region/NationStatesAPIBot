# NationStatesAPIBot
A Bot for performing API Actions on NationStates and to provide other features via DiscordAPI. It can be controlled via discord.

I wrote this bot for the discord server of the [region](https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_free_nations_region "The Free Nations Region") where i am currently member of. 

It can send automatically recruitment telegrams via the NationStates API.
It will check if the recipient would receive the telegram before actually sending it, if not it will be skipped. Which increases the efficency because no telegrams are wasted.

It is intended to provide:
  - some statistics from NationStates API to discord users
  - verification of nation ownership via the NationStates API (To-Do)
  - backup functionality of discord channel chat logs. (To-Do)
  - a lot other cool stuff
  
It will be extended as needed.

It can probably be used for general purpose as well.

Feel free to contribute!
